Types: Supervised (labeled data) 
Unsupervised (no labels) 
Reinforcement (learning through rewards)

Structured / Unstructured Data 
Structured (Tabular: CSV,SQL Tables) 
Unstructured (Text, images, videos)

Training Set: Used to train the model 
Testing Set: Used to evaluate final model performance
 **Validation Set: (optional) Used for tuning models (hyperparameters)

Basic Probability & Statistics Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation Probability, Conditional Probability Distributions (Normal, Skewed)

Standard Deviation (Spread of data) Measures how far values are from the mean

Low std dev = data tightly packed 
High std dev = data is spread out

Group A: [150, 151,149, 150, 150] 
Group B: [100, 200, 150, 180, 120]

Chances of an event occuring is Probability If 20 out of 100 people have heart disease
 P(disease)= 20 / 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20%

Conditional Probability Probability of one event given that another event has occured
 P(disease|Chest Pain = Yes) = Probability that a patient has heart disease given that they reported chest pain

Correlation vs Causation

COrrelation: -1 to +1 0: no correlation Higher cholesterol might be correlated with higher chance of heart disease

Causation: One variable directly causes a change in another

Ex: Smoking causes lung damage

Bias: Error from wrong assumptions

Bias is the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm Leads to underfitting

Variance is error due to model sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set High Variance: Model captures noise and fluctuations, not just the undelying problem Leads to overfitting

Underfitting: Happens when your model is too simple to learn the underlying pattern Both training and testing errors are high

Overfitting: Model learns both the signal and the noise from training data training error is very low, but test error is high
